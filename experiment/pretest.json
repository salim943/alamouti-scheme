    {
      "question": "Why does the Alamouti scheme maintain orthogonality at the receiver despite multipath fading?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Because it uses BPSK modulation only",
        "b": "Due to the special structure of the transmit matrix",
        "c": "Because of perfect power control at the transmitter",
        "d": "Because fading is assumed to be Gaussian"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The orthogonality is not dependent on modulation type alone.",
        "b": "Correct. The Alamouti matrix structure preserves orthogonality even under fading.",
        "c": "Power control is unrelated to orthogonality in this context.",
        "d": "Fading characteristics affect reliability, not matrix orthogonality."

    {
      "question": "What condition must the channel satisfy for the Alamouti scheme to guarantee maximum diversity gain?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Fading must be independent across transmit antennas",
        "b": "The receiver must estimate noise accurately",
        "c": "Transmit antennas must be tightly spaced",
        "d": "Channel coefficients must be constant for at least four time slots"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Independent fading across antennas ensures full diversity.",
        "b": "Noise estimation helps but is not the key requirement for diversity gain.",
        "c": "Tight spacing reduces spatial diversity.",
        "d": "Two time slots are sufficient; four is unnecessary."

      "question": "If the channel changes between the two Alamouti time slots, what is the likely impact?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Improved bit error rate due to channel diversity",

        "c": "Loss of orthogonality and degraded decoding performance",
        "d": "The system becomes resistant to Doppler effects"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Channel variation disrupts orthogonality, worsening BER.",
        "b": "Complexity doesn't help if decoding structure breaks.",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Alamouti is a time-domain scheme, not frequency spreading.",
        "b": "Guard intervals help with multipath, not directly related to Alamouti decoding.",
        "c": "Correct. Orthogonal structure ensures symbols can be decoded independently.",
        "d": "Cyclic prefix is used in OFDM, not Alamouti directly."

        "d": "BPSK must be used for all subcarriers"
      },
      "explanations": {
